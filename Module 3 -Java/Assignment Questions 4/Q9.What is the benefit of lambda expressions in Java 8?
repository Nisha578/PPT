Q9.What is the benefit of lambda expressions in Java 8?

Ans = Conciseness
Functional interfaces can be succinctly represented using lambda expressions. Functional interfaces, which are interfaces with
a single abstract method, are the fundamental units of Java 8's lambda expressions. We can more succinctly explain the implementation 
of the functional interface using a lambda expression than we can with an unnamed inner class.

Readability
Lambda expressions make the code more readable by eliminating the need for boilerplate code that would typically be required 
for anonymous inner classes. This makes the code more expressive and easier to understand, as the programmer can focus on the 
intent of the code rather than the implementation details.

Flexibility
We are able to develop more adaptable code with lambda expressions. We may quickly give behaviour to a method as a parameter by 
utilising functional interfaces and lambda expressions. As a result, our code is more modular and can be applied to various situations.
