Q6.Explain the difference between the RequestDispatcher.forward() and HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect() methods?

Ans = 1. The forward () method of the RequestDispatcher works on the server-side, while the SendRedirect() method works on the client-side.

2. Request dispatcher works on the request object, while SendRedirect() works on the response object.

3. The forward() method is also significantly faster than the SendRedirect(). This is because, unlike the forward() method, 
the SendRedirect() method necessitates two browser
requests instead of one.
