Q9.Distinguish between a hashmap and a Treemap.

Ans =  HashMap:
=> HashMap allows heterogeneous elements because it does not perform sorting on keys. 
=> HashMap is faster than TreeMap because it provides constant-time performance that is O(1) for the basic operations like get() and put().
=> The HashMap class uses the hash table.

TreeMap:
=> TreeMap allows homogeneous values as a key because of sorting.
=> TreeMap is slow in comparison to HashMap because it provides the performance of O(log(n)) for most operations like add(), remove()
and contains().
=> TreeMap internally uses a Red-Black tree, which is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree.
