Q7.What are Spring Beans?

Ans = The objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans.
A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container. These beans are created with the
configuration metadata that you supply to the container.
