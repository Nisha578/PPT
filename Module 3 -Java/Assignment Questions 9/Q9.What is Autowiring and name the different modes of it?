Q9.What is Autowiring and name the different modes of it?

Ans = Spring is an open-source application development framework of Java that allows you to create robust enterprise applications
using Plain Old Java Objects (POJO in short). The Spring framework can inject dependencies automatically. The Spring container detects
those dependencies specified in the configuration file and @ the relationship between the beans. This is referred to as autowiring in 
Spring.

There are five modes of autowiring:

1. No

This mode tells the framework that autowiring is not supposed to be done. It is the default mode used by Spring.

2. byName

It uses the name of the bean for injecting dependencies. However, it requires that the name of the property and bean must be the same.
It invokes the setter method internally for autowiring.

3. byType

It injects the dependency according to the type of the bean. It looks up in the configuration file for the class type of the property.
If it finds a bean that matches, it injects the property. If not, the program throws an error.

4. constructor

It injects the required dependencies by invoking the constructor. It works similar to the “byType” mode but it looks for the class 
type of the constructor arguments.

5. autodetect

The autodetect mode uses two other modes for autowiring – constructor and byType. It first tries to autowire via the constructor mode 
and if it fails, it uses the byType mode for autowiring.
