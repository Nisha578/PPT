Q6.What is the lambda expression of Java 8?

Ans = Lambda expressions were one of the new features that was introduced in Java 8.

They help clean up verbose code by providing a concise and local way to reduce redundancy by keeping code short and self-explanatory.

In addition to saving code, Javaâ€™s lambda expressions are important in functional programming. They allow developers to write in a
functional style by acting as functions without belonging to any class.

Lambda expressions allow us to implement functional interfaces by converting them into instances of functional interfaces. 
This provides a reference to the function. For example, a lambda passed as a parameter is indistinguishable to calling an 
implemented interface method). Thus, the references are used effectively as a function type object that can be passed and called on.

Syntax
([argument-list]) -> {body} 
Lambda expressions have an optional argument list and a body
