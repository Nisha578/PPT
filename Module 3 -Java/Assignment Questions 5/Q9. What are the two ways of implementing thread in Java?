Q9. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?

Ans  = By extending the thread class 
By implementing a Runnable interface 
 we can create a thread by extending the thread class.

Extending Thread Class :
To create a thread using the thread class, we need to extend the thread class. Java's multithreading system is based on the thread class.

class MyThread extends Thread{
    @Override
    public void run(){
        int i =0;
        while(i<40000){
            System.out.println("My Cooking Thread is Running");
            System.out.println("I am happy!");
            i++;
        }
    }
}
public class Thread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
    t1.start();
    }
}
