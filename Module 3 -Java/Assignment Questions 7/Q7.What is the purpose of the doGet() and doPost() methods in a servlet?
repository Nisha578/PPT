Q7.What is the purpose of the doGet() and doPost() methods in a servlet?

Ans = The doGet method is called by the server (via the service method) when the client requests a GET request.
It is used to retrieve information from the server. 
 
-> doGet() shall be used when small amount of data and insensitive data like a query has to be sent as a request. 

-> The doPost method is called by the server (via the service method) when the client requests a POST request. 
It is used to send information to the server.

->doPost() shall be used when comparatively large amount of sensitive data has to be sent.
