Q7.What is the Differentiate between Comparable and Comparator

Ans = Comparable:
=> A comparable interface is implemented by all the String class and wrapper classes. Moreover, custom objects use a
comparable interface for sorting. 
=> Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.
=> Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.

Comparator:
=>  The comparator interface is chiefly used to sort the custom objects. You can use it to compare the objects of different classes too.
=> Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
=> Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
