Q3.What are the types of statement in JDBC in java?

Ans =  Statement: This is used to create simple SQL statements with no parameter. 
An example is: Statement statemnt1 = conn.createStatement();. This statement returns the ResultSet object.

PreparedStatement: This extends the Statement interface. It improves the application's performance because it has more features
and compiles the query only once. It is used for precompiled SQL statements that have parameters.

CallableStatement: CallableStatements also extends the PreparedStatement interface. It is used for SQL statements with 
parameters that invoke procedure or function in the database. It is simply created by calling the prepare all method of the connection
object.
