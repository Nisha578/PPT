Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?

Ans = You might already be familiar with systems like a vending machine, a bank locker, or even a purse. All of these contain 
some items in them. Items that are contained within a system are made available to use through the system.

For example, you can not directly access a snack from a vending machine without having to use the machine. The vending machine
has a few defined procedures which allow you to access the items in it. This is exactly what is meant by Encapsulation.

In the world of programming, encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.

Javascript Program:

let student = {
	id: 12,
	name: "Isaac",
	marks: 81
}
console.log(student.name) // Prints Isaac
console.log(student.id) // Prints 12
console.log(student.marks) // Prints 81
