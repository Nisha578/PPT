Q10.Define LinkedHashMap in Java.

Ans = A LinkedHashMap contains values based on the key. It implements the Map interface and extends the HashMap class. 
It contains only unique elements. It may have one null key and multiple null values.
=> The main use of LinkedHashMap in Java is to use it for preserving the insertion order. It can also be used to preserve 
the access order using which the keys are accessed.
