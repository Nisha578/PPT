Q10.What do you mean by garbage collection?

Ans = Garbage collection in Java is the automated process of deleting code that's no longer needed or used. This automatically frees up
memory space and ideally makes coding Java apps easier for developers. Java applications are compiled into bytecode that may be executed 
by a JVM.Garbage collection in Java is the automated process of deleting code that's no longer needed or used. This automatically frees up
