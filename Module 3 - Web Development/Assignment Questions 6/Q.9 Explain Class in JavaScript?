Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?

Ans = Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are
unique to classes.
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}
