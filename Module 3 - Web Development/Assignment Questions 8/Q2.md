Q.2 What do you understand by Virtual Dom?

Ans = The virtual DOM provides a mechanism that abstracts manual DOM manipulations away from the developer, helping us to write more 
predictable code. It does so by comparing two render trees to determine exactly what has changed, only updating what is necessary on 
the actual DOM.
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with 
the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
In React world, the term "virtual DOM" is usually associated with React elements since they are the objects representing the user interface.
