Q3.What is a Spring configuration file?

Ans = A Spring configuration file is an XML file that contains the class information. It describes how those classes are configured
as well as introduced to each other. The XML configuration files, however, are verbose and cleaner.

Spring configuration file is a file with .xml extension and the file contains information about the classes and interfaces and
their dependencies. Using this file the spring container controls the life cycle of a spring bean and also Dependency Injection is 
achieved.
