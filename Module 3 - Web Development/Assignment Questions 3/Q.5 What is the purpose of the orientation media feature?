Q.5 What is the purpose of the orientation media feature?

Ans = The orientation feature is specified as a keyword value chosen from the list below.

Keyword values:
portrait
The viewport is in a portrait orientation, i.e., the height is greater than or equal to the width.

landscape
The viewport is in a landscape orientation, i.e., the width is greater than the height.

Portrait orientation:
In this example we have three boxes in the HTML and use the orientation media feature to switch between a row layout (in landscape) 
and a column layout (in portrait).

The example output is embedded in an <iframe> whose height is greater than its width, so the boxes get a column layout.

Landscape orientation:
This example has exactly the same code as the previous example: it has three boxes in the HTML, and uses the orientation media
feature to switch between a row layout (in landscape) and a column layout (in portrait).

However, in this example, the example output is embedded in an <iframe> whose height is less than its width, so the boxes get a row
layout.
