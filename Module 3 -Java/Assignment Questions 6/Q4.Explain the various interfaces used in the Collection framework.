Q4.Explain the various interfaces used in the Collection framework.

Ans = List: The List interface extends the Collection interface and represents an ordered collection of elements. 
Lists allow duplicate elements and maintain the insertion order. Common implementations of List include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

Set: The Set interface, also an extension of the Collection interface, represents a collection that does not allow 
duplicate elements. Sets typically do not maintain a specific order of elements. Notable implementations of Set are HashSet, 
TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.

Queue: The Queue interface defines a collection that represents a waiting area, where elements are inserted at one end and 
removed from the other. Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Notable implementations of Queue include LinkedList 
and PriorityQueue.

Map: The Map interface represents a mapping between unique keys and corresponding values. It does not extend the Collection
interface but is an important part of the Java Collection framework. Maps do not allow duplicate keys and are commonly used 
for key-value pair associations. Notable implementations of Map include HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.
