Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?

Ans = “This” keyword refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code. It references the object that is executing 
the current function. If the function being referenced is a regular function, “this” references the global object. If the function
that is being referenced is a method in an object, “this” references the object itself.

The JavaScript “this” keyword is one of the most widely used keywords. It can seem complex at first, but once you start using “this”
keyword, everything will become clear.

The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the 
confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name
