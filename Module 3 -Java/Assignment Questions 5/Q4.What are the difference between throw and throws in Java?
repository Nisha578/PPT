Q4.What are the difference between throw and throws in Java?

Ans = The Throw Keyword:
The throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly by the programmer

    if ( b===0 ) {
       throw new ArithmeticException("Div by 0");
          }
     else{
             return a/b ;
         }
In a similar manner, we can throw user-defined exceptions:                                              

 throw new My Exception ( "Exception throw" );

The throw Keyword:
Throws java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.

This gives information to the programmer that there might be an exception so it's better to be prepared with a try-catch block!

    public void calculate (int a, int b) throws IOException {

            // code

    }

The Throws Keyword:

-> Java throws keyword is used in the method signature to declare an exception which might be thrown by the function
while the execution of the code.

-> The throws keyword is followed by class names of Exceptions to be thrown.
