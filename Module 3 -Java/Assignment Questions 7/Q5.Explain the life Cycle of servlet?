Q5.Explain the life cycle of servlet?

Ans =  the life cycle of the servlet:

-> Servlet class is loaded.
The classloader is responsible to load the servlet class. The servlet class is loaded when the first request for the servlet 
is received by the web container.

-> Servlet instance is created.
The web container creates the instance of a servlet after loading the servlet class. The servlet instance is created only once in the 
servlet life cycle.

-> init method is invoked.
public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException 

-> service method is invoked.
public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)   
  throws ServletException, IOException  

-> destroy method is invoked.
public void destroy()
