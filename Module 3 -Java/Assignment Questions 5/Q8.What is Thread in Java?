Q8.What is Thread in Java?

Ans  = A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of execution
running concurrently. Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority.

class Multi extends Thread{  
public void run(){  
System.out.println("thread is running...");  
}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Multi func1=new Multi();  
func1.start();  
Multi func2=new Multi();  
func2.start();  
 }  
}
