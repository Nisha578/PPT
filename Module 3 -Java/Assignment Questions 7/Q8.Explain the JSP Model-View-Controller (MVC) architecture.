Q8.Explain the JSP Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

Ans = MVC stands for Model View and Controller. It is a design pattern that separates the business logic, presentation logic and data.
Controller acts as an interface between View and Model. Controller intercepts all the incoming requests.

Model represents the state of the application i.e. data. It can also have business logic.
View represents the presentaion i.e. UI(User Interface).
