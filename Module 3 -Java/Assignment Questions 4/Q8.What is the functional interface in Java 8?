Q8.What is the functional interface in Java 8?

Ans = A functional interface is an interface with only one abstract method
Lambdas are matched to functional interfaces, allowing the compiler to interpret the type of the variables in the argument list
The parameters of the lambda expression must match the parameters of the single method and the return type of the lambda must 
match the return type of the single method.

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Comparator<T> {
    int compare(T o1, T o2);
}
Anonymous classes were used as a workaround for passing references to functions, that is, compare in this case

Comparator<Person> descName = new Comparator<Person>() {
    @Override
    int compare(Person o1, Person o2) {
        return o1.getName().compareTo(o2.getName());
    }
}
