Q6.What is the Differentiate between Iterator and ListIterator in Java.

Ans = Iterator:
=> 1.  Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward direction.
2. Helps to traverse Map, List and Set.
3. Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.

ListIterator:
=> 1. Can traverse elements present in Collection both in forward and backward directions.
2. Can only traverse List and not the other two.
3. It has methods like nextIndex() and previousIndex() to obtain indexes of elements at any time while traversing List.
