Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Ans = Abstraction is used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation about the data so that users only see the
required information. It is one of the most important and essential features of object-oriented programming. 
Pre-defined functions are similar to data abstraction.

Objects are the building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming. An object contains some properties and methods. We can hide them 
from the outer world through access modifiers. We can provide access only for required functions and properties to the other programs.
This is the general procedure to implement abstraction in OOPS.

function Person() {
    this.name = "Alex";
    if (this.constructor === Person) {
     throw new Error("Your Error Message...");
    }
};
Person.prototype.info = function () {
    return "Person name is: " + this.name;
}
function Teacher(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Teacher.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
var teacher1 = new Teacher("Stepheny");
console.log(teacher1.info());
