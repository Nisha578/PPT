Q5.What is multithreading in Java? mention its advantages

Ans =  Multithreading is used to achive multitasking. 
Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously formaximum utilization of the CPU. 
A thread in Java is a lightweight process requiring fewer resources to create and share the process resources.

Advantages: 

-> Improved throughput. Many concurrent compute operations and I/O requests within a single process.

-> Simultaneous and fully symmetric use of multiple processors for computation and I/O

-> Superior application responsiveness. If a request can be launched on its own thread, applications do not freeze or show the "hourglass". 
An entire application will not block, or otherwise wait, pending the completion of another request.

-> Improved server responsiveness. Large or complex requests or slow clients don't block other requests for service. 
The overall throughput of the server is much greater.
