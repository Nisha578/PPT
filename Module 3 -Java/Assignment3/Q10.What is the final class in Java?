The final class is a class that is declared with the final keyword. Subclasses can't inherit a final class or 
a final class cannot be inherited by any subclass. So, we can restrict class inheritance by making use of a final class.
Syntax:
final class className 
{
    // Body of class
}
Program:
final class myFinalClass 
{
    void myFinalMethod() 
    {
        System.out.println("We are in the final class we just created");
    }
}

class MainClass
{
    public static void main(String arg[])
    {
        myFinalClass fc = new myFinalClass();
        fc.myFinalMethod();
    }
}
