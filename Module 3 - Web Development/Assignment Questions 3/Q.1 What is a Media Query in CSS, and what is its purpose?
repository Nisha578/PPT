Q.1 What is a Media Query in CSS, and what is its purpose?

Ans => Media queries are used when we want to customize our website's presentation according to the user's screen size. 
With the help of media queries, you can display different markups based upon the device's general type(mobile, desktop, tablet).

=> A media query is a logical operation. Whenever a media query becomes true, then the related CSS is applied to the target element.

Syntax Of Media Query :
A media query is composed of two things: media type and expression. A media query can contain one or more expressions. 

Syntax :

@media media-type and (media-feature)
{
/* CSS Rules to be applies*/
}
Example: 

@media screen and (max-width: 800px)
{
#contents{width:90%}
}

Purpose:

1. Media queries allow us to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or other characteristics
such as screen resolution or browser viewport width. 

 2. They allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to detect other
things about the environment your site is running on, for example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse.
