Q.4 Explain OOPS ? 

Ans = Object-Oriented Programming is a programming style based on classes and objects. These group data (properties) and 
methods (actions) inside a box.

OOP was developed to make code more flexible and easier to maintain.

JavaScript is prototype-based procedural language, which means it supports both functional and object-oriented programming.

Object: An Object is a unique entity that contains properties and methods. For example “a car” is a real-life Object, which has some
characteristics like color, type, model, and horsepower and performs certain actions like driving. The characteristics of an Object 
are called Properties in Object-Oriented Programming and the actions are called methods. An Object is an instance of a class. Objects 
are everywhere in JavaScript, almost every element is an Object whether it is a function, array, or string.


Classes: Classes are blueprints of an Object. A class can have many Objects because the class is a template while Objects are instances 
of the class or the concrete implementation. 
Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented languages there are no classes in JavaScript
we have only Object. To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype-based Object Oriented Language, which means it doesn’t have classes, 
rather it defines behaviors using a constructor function and then reuses it using the prototype.
