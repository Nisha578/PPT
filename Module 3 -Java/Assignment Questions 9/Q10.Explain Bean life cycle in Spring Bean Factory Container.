Q10.Explain Bean life cycle in Spring Bean Factory Container.

Ans = Bean life cycle is managed by the spring container. When we run the program then, first of all, the spring container gets started.
After that, the container creates the instance of a bean as per the request, and then dependencies are injected. And finally, the bean is 
destroyed when the spring container is closed.
Therefore, if we want to execute some code on the bean instantiation and just after closing the spring container, then we can write that 
code inside the custom init() method and the destroy() method.

Note:
We can choose a custom method name instead of init() and destroy(). Here, we will use init() method to execute all its code as 
the spring container starts up and the bean is instantiated, and destroy() method to execute all its code on closing the container.
