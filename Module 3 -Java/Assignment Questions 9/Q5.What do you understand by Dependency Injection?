Q5.What do you understand by Dependency Injection?

Ans = Dependency injection enables us to turn regular Java classes into managed objects and to inject them into any other managed object.
Using dependency injection, our code can declare dependencies on any managed object. The container automatically provides instances of 
these dependencies at the injection points at runtime, and it also manages the lifecycle of these instances for us.

Dependency injection in Java EE defines scopes, which determine the lifecycle of the objects that the container instantiates and injects.
For example, a managed object that is only needed to respond to a single client request (such as a currency converter) has a different
scope than a managed object that is needed to process multiple client requests within a session (such as a shopping cart).
