Q3.What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions and Error?

Ans = : A checked exception is caught at compile time whereas a runtime or unchecked exception is, as it states, at runtime.

Checked Exceptions:
-> The compiler checks a checked exception..
-> These types of exceptions can be handled at the time of compilation.	
-> They are the sub-class of the exception class.

unchecked Exceptions
	-> The compiler does not check these types of exceptions.
-> These types of exceptions cannot be a catch or handle at the time of compilation, because they get generated by the mistakes in
the program.
->	They are runtime exceptions and hence are not a part of the Exception class.

Errors:

->The error indicates trouble that primarily occurs due to the scarcity of system resources.
