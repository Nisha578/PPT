Q10.What are the limitations of JSP?

Ans = 
Disadvantages of using JSP:

As the JSP is compiled on the server, it is not memory and time-efficient. It is hard to track errors in JSP files because they are an
extension to Servlets. The JSP codes are processed into Servlet codes for compilation.
As JSP is an HTML file, it doesn't provide many features.
