Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?

Ans = A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a constructor 
  gets called when an object is created using the new keyword.
  When a constructor gets invoked in JavaScript, the following sequence of operations take place:

-> A new empty object gets created.
-> The this keyword begins to refer to the new object and it becomes the current instance object.
-> The new object is then returned as the return value of the constructor.

  //Constructor
function User() {
    this.name = 'Bob';
}

var user = new User();

The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.
  
Constructors are used to initialize the objects of the class with initial values. Constructors are invoked automatically when the 
objects are created. Constructors can have default parameters.
