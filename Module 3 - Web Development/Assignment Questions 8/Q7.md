Q.7 Explain Prop Drilling in React & Ways to avoid it.

Ans = Prop drilling occurs when you need to pass down data through multiple nested components to reach the ones that require the data.
This practice can lead to a complex and tightly coupled component hierarchy, making it challenging to manage state and refactor your
application.

Step 1: Create a Context
First, create a new context using `React.createContext()`. The context is an object with two components: Provider and Consumer.
The Provider component is used to wrap the part of your component tree that needs access to the context data, while the Consumer 
component is used by any component that needs to access the shared data.

import React from 'react'

const AppContext = React.createContext();

export default AppContext;

Step 2: Provide the Context
Wrap your component tree in the Provider component and pass the data you want to share as a value prop. 

import React from 'react'
import AppContext from './AppContext';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function App() {
  const sharedData = {
    theme: 'dark',
    user: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    },
  };

  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={sharedData}>
      <ChildComponent />
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default App;


Step 3: Consume the Context Using Hooks
Now that the Provider component is set up, you can access the shared data in any child component using the useContext Hook. This Hook
accepts the context object as a parameter and returns the current context value.


import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import AppContext from './AppContext';

function GrandChildComponent() {
  const { theme, user } = useContext(AppContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Theme: {theme}</h1>
      <p>User: {user.name}</p>
      <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default GrandChildComponent;
