Q.10 Whatâ€™s Super Keyword & What it does?

Ans = The super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods.

Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class, by using the extends keyword.

By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties
and methods:
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.carname;
  }
}

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(brand, mod) {
    super(brand);
    this.model = mod;
  }
  show() {
    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model;
  }
}

mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = mycar.show();
