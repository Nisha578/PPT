Q.3 Explain the concept of Breakpoints in Responsive Web Design and How They are used in Media Queries.

Ans = Media query breakpoints are pixel values that a developer/designer can define in CSS. When a responsive website reaches those
pixel values, a transformation (such as the one detailed above) occurs so that the website offers an optimal user experience.

/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...}

/* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...}

/* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}

/* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...}

/* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}
