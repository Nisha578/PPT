Q.7  Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?

Ans = The JavaScript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes. It provides
flexibility to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.

The JavaScript extends keyword is used to create a child class on the basis of a parent class. It facilitates child class to acquire
all the properties and behavior of its parent class.

class Moment extends Date {  
  constructor() {  
    super();  
  }}  
var m=new Moment();  
document.writeln("Current date:")  
document.writeln(m.getDate()+"-"+(m.getMonth()+1)+"-"+m.getFullYear());
